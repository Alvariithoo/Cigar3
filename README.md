# **Cigar3**
A fast **Protocol 6** Agar.io client for private servers

![Cigar3](https://i.imgur.com/HZy0eHA.png)

## **Getting started.**
After installing [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), run `npm install` and `npm run cigar3` in a terminal. Then just paste in your browser `localhost:3000` to enjoy the client.

## **Where can I get some help?**
If you need extra help with anything you should ask it in the [Agar.io Private Servers Discord](https://discord.gg/XcKgShT) and not in issues.

## **How do I add a server?**
Just add a new ip adress and name in `./web/servers.json`.

## **How do I add a skin?**
Just add a new label and a path to your skin in `./web/skins.json`. I would recommend you putting skins in the `./web/skins` directory. PNG is the recommended format.

## **What server should I use?**
Recommended server, [OgarII](https://github.com/Luka967/OgarII) by Luka.

## **Why Cigar3?**
I wanted to have multiple files and a webgl support. Those changes would make [Cigar2](https://github.com/Cigar2/Cigar2) too different from original. I'm still using some code from cigar2 tho.
